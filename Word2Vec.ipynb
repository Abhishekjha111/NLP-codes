        "Image and audio processing systems work with rich, high-dimensional datasets encoded as vectors of the individual raw pixel-intensities for image data, thus all the information is encoded in the data hence the relation between various entities in the system like (cats and dogs) can be established.\n",

This means that the model can leverage very little of what it has learned about ‘cats’ when it is processing data about ‘dogs’ (such that they are both animals, four-legged, pets, etc).\n",

It tries to predict the source context words (surrounding words) given a target word (the center word). Considering our simple sentence from earlier, “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”. If we used the CBOW model, we get pairs of (context_window, target_word)where if we consider a context window of size 2, we have examples like ([quick, fox], brown), ([the, brown], quick), ([the, dog], lazy) and so on. Now considering that the skip-gram model’s aim is to predict the context from the target word, the model typically inverts the contexts and targets, and tries to predict each context word from its target word. Hence the task becomes to predict the context [quick, fox] given target word ‘brown’ or [the, brown] given target word ‘quick’ and so on. Thus the model tries to predict the context_window words based on the target_word"

We will pass each of them to an embedding layer of their own, having size (vocab_size x embed_size) which will give us dense word embeddings for each of these two words (1 x embed_size for each word). Next up we use a merge layer to compute the dot product of these two embeddings and get the dot product value. This is then sent to the dense sigmoid layer which outputs either a 1 or 0. We compare this with the actual label Y (1 or 0), compute the loss, backpropagate the errors to adjust the weights (in the embedding layer) and repeat this process for all (target, context) pairs for multiple epochs.
