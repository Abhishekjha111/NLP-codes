        "**Information retrieval** (IR) is the activity of obtaining information system resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of those resources. Searches can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the metadata that describes data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds.  Web search engines are the most visible IR applications."

        "An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or database. User queries are matched against the database information. However, as opposed to classical SQL queries of a database, in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query, so results are typically ranked. This ranking of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching.\n",
        "\n",
        "Depending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images, audio, mind maps or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query."

            "Abstract:  OBJECTIVES: Peer counseling may improve upon provider counseling and enhance patient preparedness for midurethral sling (MUS) surgery. We aimed to compare the impact of peer-centered versus standard preoperative video counseling by assessing patient preparedness for MUS surgery. METHODS: Women undergoing MUS were randomized to view either a peer-centered (PEER) or standard physician preoperative counseling video (PHYS). The PEER video featured a woman who had undergone MUS surgery and included the standard risks and benefits as well as additional information identified in prior work as important to patients. The PHYS video featured a surgeon discussing risks and benefits. Patients viewed either video at their preoperative visit and completed the Patient Preparedness Questionnaire (PPQ), Surgical Decision Satisfaction, Decisional Regret Scale, and the Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form. Patients then underwent standard in-person surgeon counseling. Sessions were timed and compared with historical timed sessions. Our primary outcome was between-group differences in 6-week postoperative PPQ scores. RESULTS: Patient Preparedness Questionnaire scores did not differ between groups (postoperative PPQ scores: median [interquartile range], 95 [84, 100] vs 92 [80, 100]; P = 0.50). The PEER group reported higher decisional regret (15 [0, 28.75] vs 0 [0, 10], P = 0.02) and less symptom improvement on Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form change scores compared with the PHYS group (47.2 [37.2, 62.5] vs 36.1 [16.5, 50], P = 0.03); secondary outcomes were not different between groups. In-person counseling times decreased after watching either video compared with the institution's historical standard (8:27 minutes [08:56, 17:14] vs 11:34 minutes [5:22, 13:07]; P < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Patient preparedness did not differ between groups. Decision regret did not differ between groups once adjusted for urinary symptoms.\n"

            "Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides a contemporary review of sleep apnea with emphasis on definitions, epidemiology, and consequences. RECENT FINDINGS: Amyloid beta-42 is one of the main peptides forming amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer patients. Poorer sleep quality and shorter sleep duration have been associated with a higher amyloid burden. Decreased sleep time in the elderly is a precipitating factor in amyloid retention. Studies have shown that the dysregulation of the homeostatic balance of the major inhibitory and excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter systems of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate play a role in sleep disordered breathing (SDB). SUMMARY: Untreated sleep disordered breathing (obstructive sleep apnea and/or central sleep apnea) are an important cause of medical mortality and morbidity. OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during sleep followed by hypoxia and sympathetic activation. Apneic events are terminated by arousal, followed by increases in pulse and blood pressure, and re-oxygenation and the release of inflammatory factors. Individuals with OSA have an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation. Hypoxemia and poor sleep quality because of OSA increase the risk of cognitive decline in the elderly.\n",
            "\n",
            "Abstract: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), including OSA and central sleep apnea, is highly prevalent in patients with heart failure (HF). Multiple studies have reported this high prevalence in asymptomatic as well as symptomatic patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF), as well as in those with HF with preserved ejection fraction. The acute pathobiologic consequences of OSA, including exaggerated sympathetic activity, oxidative stress, and inflammation, eventually could lead to progressive left ventricular dysfunction, repeated hospitalization, and excessive mortality. Large numbers of observational studies and a few small randomized controlled trials have shown improvement in various cardiovascular consequences of SDB with treatment. There are no long-term randomized controlled trials to show improved survival of patients with HF and treatment of OSA. One trial of positive airway pressure treatment of OSA included patients with HF and showed no improvement in clinical outcomes. However, any conclusions derived from this trial must take into account several important pitfalls that have been extensively discussed in the literature. With the role of positive airway pressure as the sole therapy for SDB in HF increasingly questioned, a critical examination of long-accepted concepts in this field is needed. The objective of this review was to incorporate recent advances in the field into a phenotype-based approach to the management of OSA in HF.\n",

            "Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To understand the importance of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in the cognitive and sensorimotor development via neural plasticity during embryonic development and infants. RECENT FINDINGS: REM sleep has remained a mystery as many of the underlying mechanisms of REM sleep remain unclear. Recent findings have demonstrated that REM sleep selectively prunes newly formed dendritic spines in the developing brain as well as strengthening new synapses in the developing brain. This process is critical for normal neuronal circuit development and behavioral improvement after learning. SUMMARY: Although many mechanisms of REM sleep remain unclear, recent findings strongly suggest that REM sleep is vitally important in pruning synapses as well as maintaining new synapses for the development of a healthy brain. Developmental neuroplasticity refers to the continuous change of the developing brain during fetal development. Lack of plasticity may result in reduced intellectual ability, reduced learning and memory consolidation, and mental illness.\n",

            "Abstract: Sleep is critically important to consolidate information learned throughout the day. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) serves to consolidate declarative memories, a process previously modulated with open-loop non-invasive electrical stimulation, though not always effectively. These failures to replicate could be explained by the fact that stimulation has only been performed in open-loop, as opposed to closed-loop where phase and frequency of the endogenous slow-wave oscillations (SWOs) are matched for optimal timing. The current study investigated the effects of closed-loop transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) targeting SWOs during sleep on memory consolidation. 21 participants took part in a three-night, counterbalanced, randomized, single-blind, within-subjects study, investigating performance changes (correct rate and F1 score) on images in a target detection task over 24 h. During sleep, 1.5 mA closed-loop tACS was delivered in phase over electrodes at F3 and F4 and 180 degrees out of phase over electrodes at bilateral mastoids at the frequency (range 0.5-1.2 Hz) and phase of ongoing SWOs for a duration of 5 cycles in each discrete event throughout the night. Data were analyzed in a repeated measures ANOVA framework, and results show that verum stimulation improved post-sleep performance specifically on generalized versions of images used in training at both morning and afternoon tests compared to sham, suggesting the facilitation of schematization of information, but not of rote, veridical recall. We also found a surprising inverted U-shaped dose effect of sleep tACS, which is interpreted in terms of tACS-induced faciliatory and subsequent refractory dynamics of SWO power in scalp EEG. This is the first study showing a selective modulation of long-term memory generalization using a novel closed-loop tACS approach, which holds great potential for both healthy and neuropsychiatric populations.\n",

            "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe sociodemographic factors and health behaviors among American Indian (AI) families with young children and determine predictors of adult and child weight status among these factors. DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional baseline data. SETTING: One urban area and 4 rural AI reservations nationwide. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 450 AI families with children aged 2-5 years participating in the Healthy Children, Strong Families 2 intervention. INTERVENTION: Baseline data from a healthy lifestyles intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Child body mass index (BMI) z-score and adult BMI, and multiple healthy lifestyle outcomes. ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics and stepwise regression. RESULTS: Adult and child combined overweight and obesity rates were high: 82% and 40%, respectively. Food insecurity was high (61%). Multiple lifestyle behaviors, including fruit and vegetable and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, adult physical activity, and child screen time, did not meet national recommendations. Adult sleep was adequate but children had low overnight sleep duration of 10 h/d. Significant predictors of child obesity included more adults in the household (P = .003; beta = 0.153), an adult AI caregiver (P = .02; beta = 0.116), high adult BMI (P = .001; beta = 0.176), gestational diabetes, high child birth weight (P < .001; beta = 0.247), and the family activity and nutrition score (P = .04; beta = 0.130). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We found multiple child-, adult-, and household-level factors influence early childhood obesity in AI children, highlighting the need for interventions to mitigate the modifiable factors identified in this study, including early life influences, home environments, and health behaviors.\n",
